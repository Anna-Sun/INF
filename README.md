# INF
SCALLOP-INF analysis

The list of proteins on inflammation is within one of the [OLINK](https://www.olink.com/products/) panels (as in [Olink validation data all panels.xlsx](doc/Olink%20validation%20data%20all%20panels.xlsx)) each containing 92 proteins. Information contained in these panels can be retrieved into R via [OLINK.R](doc/OLINK.R), which also attempts to compromise earlier version and annotations.

## UniProt IDs

The latest by Jimmy is [olink.inf.panel.annot.tsv](doc/olink.inf.panel.annot.tsv) from [olink.annotation.R](doc/olink.annotation.R).

The use of [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/) IDs is rationalised in two aspects,

1. The protein list in [inf1.csv](doc/inf1.csv) found O43508 and Q4ACW9 are associated with the TNFSF12 and TWEAK genes, respectively.

2. Q8NF90 and Q8WWJ7 were not listed at the UCSC, their availability on UniProt seem to be for backward compatibility as on query they 
point to P12034 and P30203 (Q8WWJ7_HUMAN should have been CD6_HUMAN). [hgTables.tsv](doc/hgTables.tsv) is based on UCSC, checked over
UniProt IDs as follows,
```bash
grep inf1 olink.prot.list.txt | sed 's/inf1_//g;s/___/\t/g' > inf1.list
sort -k2,2 inf1.list > 1
awk '{FS=OFS="\t"; split($4,f,"-");$4=f[1];if(!index($1,"_")) print}' hgTables.tsv | sort -k4,4 > 2
join -t$'\t' -12 -24 1 2 > 12
# 90 lines
wc -l 12
# Q8NF90 (FGF.5), Q8WWJ7 (CD6) are missing
join -v2 -22 12 1
rm 1 2 12
```
A UniProt ID may be associated with multiple chromosomes, e.g., Q6IEY1 with chromosomes 1 and 5. While [inf1.csv](doc/inf1.csv) 
edits Q4ACW9, [inf2.csv](doc/inf2.csv) is inline with UCSC with respect to P12034 and P30203.

## Analysis

The CAD summary statistics used for MAGMA and MR is described [here](https://github.com/jinghuazhao/Omics-analysis/tree/master/CAD)
-- as noted in MMP12.sh, the MMP12 case could have been done genomewide. A colocalisation analysis on simulated data can be found in the
association analysis section of [software-notes](https://github.com/jinghuazhao/software-notes)
as well as the [BMI example](https://github.com/jinghuazhao/Omics-analysis/tree/master/BMI).

## A summary of files

File     | Description
---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[doc/](doc) | Some documents and auxiliary files
METAL/   | METAL results
sumstats/| reformatted summary statistics by cohort
[analysis-plan.md](analysis-plan.md) | cvd1 analysis plan
[inf1.csv](doc/inf1.csv) | UniProt ID, protein, target for the INF panel
[log10p.md](doc/log10p.md) | Jimmy's competitive log10(p) calculator
[SecureCloud.md](SecureCloud.md) | Information for SecureCloud

To implement the analysis plan, we started with analysis on INTERVAL as with [INTERVAL.sh](files/INTERVAL.sh) and [cardio.sh](doc/cardio.sh).
