As noted in MMP12.sh, the MMP12 case would have been done genomewide; the CAD summary statistics is also described 
[here](https://github.com/jinghuazhao/Omics-analysis/tree/master/CAD). A toy example with colocalisation analysis can be found
in the association analysis section of [software-notes](https://github.com/jinghuazhao/software-notes) as well as the BMI
example in [Omics-analysis](https://github.com/jinghuazhao/Omics-analysis).
