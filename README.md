SCALLOP-INF analysis

File(s)  | Description
---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[inf1.csv](doc/inf1.csv) | UniProt ID, protein, target for the INF panel linking [CVD1](doc/cvd1.txt) by [OLINK.R](doc/OLINK.R)
[logp.md](doc/logp.md) | A very competitive -log(p) calculator
MMP12 | Bash ([MMP12.sh](doc/MMP12.sh)) and R ([MMP12.R](doc/MMP12.R)) scripts for MMP12-CHD analysis
SOMAscan | Methods ([SOMAscan.md](doc/SOMAscan.md), [SOMAscan.pdf](doc/SOMAscan.pdf), [SOMAscan.tif](doc/SOMAscan.tif)) and supplementary tables ([SOMAscan.xlsx](doc/SOMAscan.xlsx)) for the SOMAscan paper (Sun et al. 2018)

As noted in MMP12.sh, the MMP12 case would have been done genomewide; the CAD summary statistics is also described 
[here](https://github.com/jinghuazhao/Omics-analysis/tree/master/CAD). A toy example with colocalisation analysis can be found
in the association analysis section of [software-notes](https://github.com/jinghuazhao/software-notes) as well as the BMI
example in [Omics-analysis](https://github.com/jinghuazhao/Omics-analysis).
